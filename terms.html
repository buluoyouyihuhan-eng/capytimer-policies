            <p>Capy Timer &nbsp;·&nbsp; Last Updated: February 22, 2026</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>By downloading or using Capy Timer, you agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User") and the
            developer of Capy Timer ("we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, installing, or using Capy Timer, you
            acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
        <p>If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the app.</p>

        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>Capy Timer is a sleep and focus timer app featuring a capybara companion. It helps users reduce phone usage
            before sleep using timed sessions, sleep sounds, app-launching automation, and an animated capybara
            character. The app operates entirely offline; no internet connection is required.</p>

        <h2>3. License Grant</h2>

        <h3>3.1 Free Version</h3>
        <p>We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the free version of Capy
            Timer for personal, non-commercial use on your own device, subject to these Terms.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Pro Version (One-Time Purchase)</h3>
        <p>Upon completing a one-time purchase, you receive an upgraded license that includes access to all Pro features
            (additional sleep sounds, extended timer durations, "Then" launch automation, and other premium features).
            This license is granted for personal use on the purchasing device and account.</p>
        <p>The Pro purchase is a <strong>lifetime license</strong> — you pay once and retain access to all Pro features
            available at the time of purchase, plus future feature updates at no additional cost.</p>

        <h2>4. Purchases and Payments</h2>

        <h3>4.1 Pricing</h3>
        <p>The Pro version is available as a one-time purchase. Pricing is displayed in your local currency at the time
            of purchase and may vary by region.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Payment Processing</h3>

            (Android ↔ iOS).</p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>All content within Capy Timer — including the application code, capybara animations, artwork, sleep sounds,
            and user interface design — is the exclusive property of the developer and is protected by applicable
            intellectual property laws.</p>
        <p>You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, sublicense, reverse-engineer, or create derivative works based on
            any part of the app without our prior written consent.</p>

        <h2>6. Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the app for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable regulations</li>
            <li>Attempt to decompile, disassemble, or reverse-engineer the app</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>7. System Permissions</h2>
        <p>To deliver its core functionality, Capy Timer requests certain device permissions (e.g., display over other
            apps, foreground service, notifications). These permissions are used solely to provide the advertised
            features. You may revoke permissions at any time in your device settings, which may limit certain app
            features.</p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>Capy Timer is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, express or implied,
            including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
            non-infringement.</p>
        <p>We do not warrant that the app will be error-free, uninterrupted, or free of harmful components. We make no
            representations about the suitability of the app for any particular use.</p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall we be liable for any indirect,
            incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data,
            or goodwill, arising out of or in connection with your use of or inability to use Capy Timer.</p>
        <p>Our total liability for any claims arising in connection with the app shall not exceed the amount you paid
            for the Pro version in the 12 months preceding the claim.</p>

        <h2>10. User Conduct and Health Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>Capy Timer is a productivity and sleep-aid tool, not a medical device. It is not intended to diagnose, treat,
            cure, or prevent any medical condition, including sleep disorders. If you have concerns about your sleep
            health, consult a qualified healthcare professional.</p>

        <h2>11. Updates and Modifications</h2>

        <h3>11.1 App Updates</h3>
        <p>We may release updates to improve the app's features, fix bugs, or address security issues. Some updates may
            be required for continued use of certain features.</p>

        <h3>11.2 Changes to Terms</h3>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will indicate changes by updating the "Last
            Updated" date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>

        <h3>11.3 Feature Changes</h3>
        <p>We may add, modify, or remove features. We will make reasonable efforts to preserve Pro features that were
            available at the time of purchase.</p>

        <h2>12. Termination</h2>
        <p>These Terms remain in effect until terminated. Your rights under these Terms will terminate automatically if
            you violate any provision. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the app and delete all copies from
            your devices.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to discontinue the app at any time with reasonable notice.</p>

        <h2>13. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Payment processing is handled by Google Play (Android) and Apple App Store (iOS). These services have their
            own terms and privacy policies, which you agree to when making purchases. We are not responsible for the
            practices of these third-party services.</p>

        <h2>14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>

        <h3>14.1 Governing Law</h3>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable law, without regard to
            conflict-of-law principles.</p>

        <h3>14.2 Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <p>We encourage you to contact us first to resolve any dispute informally. For unresolved disputes, the parties
            agree to submit to binding arbitration or, where not permitted, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
            applicable courts. Users in the EU retain the right to bring claims before their local courts.</p>

        <h2>15. Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall
            continue in full force and effect.</p>

        <h2>16. Contact Information</h2>
